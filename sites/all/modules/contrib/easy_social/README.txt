SUMMARY
------------

I have developed this project, since there is no other module simple enough to
aggregate Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus share buttons in a unique place.
Yes, there are a bunch of other social modules, but this one fits perfectly in
my needs.

That was the summary for 7.x-1.0.

Easy social is now much more than simply a quick way of adding Twitter,
Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn widgets to your site:
  - You can now define your own widgets using hook_easy_social_widgets(), more
    information here: http://drupal.org/node/1347326
  - All widgets can now define extensive customization settings
  - All widgets can now be localized easily (if the service supports it)
  - Easy Social is available both as extra fields on nodes and also as blocks
